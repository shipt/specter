# Contributing to Specter

## Welcome
We are glad you are here! We think it's awesome that you want to spend time helping us make Specter even better. We really value the community we get to be a part of, and we are grateful for your contribution. 

A quick requirement for contributors:
* Ensure your Github email address matches the address that will be used to sign the CLA
  - Your Github email address must match the same address you use when signing the CLA. Github has [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github/) on setting email addresses.
  - You must also set your git email to match this email address.
  - If you already submitted a PR, you can correct your user.name and user.email and then use git commit `--amend --reset-author` and then git push `--force` to correct the PR.

## How to Contribute to Specter

The basic workflow:
1. You have an idea or see something that you want to fix, so ...
2. Fork Specter
3. Start a new branch for your feature
    * Branch prefixes we use:
      * `feature/`: for features
      * `support/`: for general refactoring
      * `hotfix/`: something broke and we need to fix it now
4. Submit a Pull Request! Do it early and mark it `WIP` so a maintainer knows it's not ready for review just yet.
5. If you haven't signed our CLA before, then you will receive an email from HelloSign to sign the CLA.
    * The CLA request will be sent to the email address associated with your github account.
    * You cannot have your PR merged without signing the PR.
6. Request review from one of our maintainers. 
7. Get Approval. We'll let you know if there are any changes that are needed. 
8. Boom! You can merge your changes into Specter.

Pull Requests: 
- Submit a PR to get your changes approved

- Make sure you include an explanation of what's changed, why, and anything these changes affect 
- The CLA-bot will confirm that you're approved to contribute
