## How to Contribute to Specter
You meet the requirement, and you're all set to start adding to this project. What's next? 

The basic workflow:
1. You have an idea or see something that you want to fix...
2. Fork Specter
3. Start a new branch for your feature
  * branch prefixes we use:
    * `feature/`: for features
    * `support/`: for general refactoring
    * `hotfix/`: something broke and we need to fix it now
4. Submit a Pull Request! Do it early and mark it `WIP` so a maintainer knows it's not ready for review just yet. 
5. Request review from one of our maintainers. 
6. Get Approval. We'll let you know if there are any changes that are needed. 
7. Boom! You can merge your changes into Specter.
