# Contributing to Specter

## Welcome
We are glad you are here! We think it's awesome that you want to spend time helping us make Specter even better. We really value the community we get to be a part of, and we are grateful for your contribution. 

A quick requirement for contributors:
* Complete the Signing Process
  - After creating your github account, follow the instructions from the CLA bot on your first commit to sign the CLA.
* Ensure your Github email address matches the address used to sign the CLA
  - Your Github email address must match the same address you use when signing the CLA. Github has [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github/) on setting email addresses.
  - You must also set your git email to match this email address.
  - If you already submitted a PR, you can correct your user.name and user.email and then use git commit `--amend --reset-author` and then git push `--force` to correct the PR.
